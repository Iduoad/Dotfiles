# for the first way, uncomment the two lines after the if and place two '.' in front of the /$1
#       this creates a new directory in the directory where the compressed file is and dumps the content in it
# for the second way, comment the two lines under the if and place just one '.' in front of the /$1
#       this just dumps the content of the compressed file in the same directory of the compressed file
